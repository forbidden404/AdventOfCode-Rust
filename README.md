# Advent of Code in Rust

Repository with solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) written in Rust.
The project is organized similarly to [learn-opengl-rs](https://github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs/).

## Usage

Run individual days like this:
`cargo run 2015_1` (for `/src/_2015/day01.rs`).

For reduced compilation times, you may only compile the code for a certain year by adding `--no-default-features --features 2015` for example.
